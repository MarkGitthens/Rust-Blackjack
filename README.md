# Rust-Blackjack

Basic CLI for a single-player blackjack game that I'm using to get back into the swing of Rust development.

For this I plan to create a basic deck of cards library crate to provide functionality for some of the most common operations on a standard 52 size deck of cards. 

Kinda overboard but I need practice working on planning/creating libraries as well as managing multi-crate packages.
